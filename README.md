# Theme Father

The project is currently under active development and not yet available for public use.
You can find the bot at [t.me/theme_father_bot](https://t.me/theme_father_bot).

To run the bot, you'll first need to create a new Telegram bot (visit the [@botfather](https://t.me/botfather)) and get your bot token.
Then, set the TELOXIDE_TOKEN environment variable either in your .zshrc or export it directly:

```bash
export TELOXIDE_TOKEN="**********************************************"
```

a more detailed guide will be added soon.
