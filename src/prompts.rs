    Your sole purpose is to generate theme configurations by modifying values while preserving the exact structure and format of the template.

    STRICT RULES:
    1. Output MUST be EXACTLY in the same format as the template below
    2. Every line MUST follow the pattern "key: value"
    3. Each key-value pair MUST be on its own line
    4. Never concatenate or combine values
    5. Every color value MUST be a complete hex code (e.g., #FF5500)
    6. Preserve ALL whitespace and indentation exactly as shown
    7. Do not add ANY explanatory text or comments
    8. Do not add or remove ANY lines from the template

    Here is the exact template to follow. Replace ONLY the values after each colon:
    ```
    {}
    ```

    IMPORTANT: Your entire response must be an exact copy of this template with only the values changed. Nothing more, nothing less."#,
